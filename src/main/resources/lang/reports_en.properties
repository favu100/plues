explain.ImpossibleModulesBecauseOfMissingElectiveAbstractUnits=Modules which are impossible, because they contain less valid (with a proper unit associated to it) elective abstract units than required by the module definition.
amount.course=Courses:
explain.AbstractUnits=Abstract Units that do not have any units associated to them and hence are impossible to complete.
explain.AbstractUnitsWithUnits=Pairs of abstract units and units that do not have any semesters in common in a given module. Hence the unit can never be chosen as it does not satisfy the abstract unit's semester requirements.
explain.ImpossibleAbstractUnitsInModule=Module and corresponding abstract units for which it is impossible to choose a unit that satisfies the semester requirements.
explain.ImpossibleCourseModuleAbstractUnits=Courses that contain mandatory abstract units without units (due to missing links or invalid import data) in (implicitly) mandatory modules such that it is impossible to choose a unit in any of these courses.
explain.ImpossibleCourses=Impossible Courses due to missing or incomplete data.
explain.ImpossibleCoursesBecauseOfImpossibleModuleCombinations=Impossible courses, because all module combinations contain impossible modules.
explain.ImpossibleCoursesBecauseOfImpossibleModules=Set of course keys for those course that are impossible to complete due to (quasi-) mandatory modules that are impossible to complete. E.g. module has less elective abstract units than required.
explain.ImpossibleModulesBecauseOfMissingElectiveAbstractUnits=Modules which are impossible, because they contain less valid (with a proper unit associated to it) elective abstract units than required by the module definition.
explain.IncompleteModules=Modules that contain less elective abstract units than required according to the module definition.  This does not affect the validation, in the sense that we only consider the minimum of required and available modules (needed among other things in UC computation)
explain.MandatoryModules=Mandatory and quasi-mandatory modules. Quasi-mandatory modules are those modules that are not marked as mandatory, but are part of every possible combination of modules
explain.QuasiMandatoryModules=Quasi-Mandatory abstract units for each module
explain.RedundantUnitGroups=Units with redundant gruops. Gruops are redundant if they contain the same events.

Hence it is impossible to choose a different unit for each abstract unit in question.
